# Mouâ€™s dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles/scripts/setup commands to speed up a new Linux/OSX box setup

## Credit to:
* [Gianni Chiappetta](http://gf3.ca/) for sharing his [amazing collection of dotfiles](https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles)
* Mark Harwood, who put the idea for creating a dotfile repo in my head in the first place. A few of the OSX specific commands were lifted from his [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/phunky/dotfiles)
